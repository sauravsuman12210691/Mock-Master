A MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) social
media website is a dynamic platform that allows users to
connect, share, and interact with each other. Users can
create profiles, post updates, share photos and videos,
and engage with content through likes, comments, and
shares. The MongoDB database stores user data and
posts, while Express.js facilitates server-side operations.
React.js is used for building a responsive and interactive
user interface, providing seamless navigation and a
smooth user experience. Node.js powers the backend,
handling requests, managing user authentication, and
facilitating real-time updates. Together, these
technologies create a powerful and scalable social media
platform for users to connect and engage with each
other.
