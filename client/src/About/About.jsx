        <p className={`${A.aboutcontainerp} ${A.animated} ${A.fadeInLeft}`}>
          Founded in 2024, Mock-master began as a small startup with a singular vision: to empower students and job seekers to excel in their interview processes. Recognizing the gap between academic knowledge and real-world interview expectations, our founders, a group of career coaches and HR professionals, devised a platform that simulates the interview environment. Over the years, we've grown from a modest blog sharing interview tips to a comprehensive platform offering personalized mock interview experiences across various industries.

          Our primary purpose at Mock-master is to demystify the job interview process and equip candidates with the tools they need to succeed.

Our goals include expanding our reach to include more industries and job levels, continuously updating our question bank with the latest trends in hiring, and enhancing our technology to provide a more immersive mock interview experience.
